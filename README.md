## üöÄ How It Works

This project leverages the **Philippine Standard Geographic Code (PSGC) API** to dynamically update the available address selections. Here's how it functions:

1. **User Selection:** The user selects a region from the dropdown.
2. **Dynamic Update:** Based on the selected region, the provinces list updates.
3. **Further Selection:** Selecting a province updates the list of cities/municipalities.
4. **Barangay Level:** After selecting a city/municipality, the barangay list is generated.
5. **Submission:** Once all selections are made, submitting the form will display the full address chosen.

This dynamic approach ensures accurate location selection and eliminates manual input errors.
